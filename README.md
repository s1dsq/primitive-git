# Write just enough to push to github

This script generates a `.git` folder in the current directory with a single
commit on the master branch which is just enough to push to github. See the
[blog post](https://s1dsq.github.io/git-internals/) for more details. The
generated git repo is [here](https://github.com/s1dsq/basic-git-repo)
